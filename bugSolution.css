The solution is to avoid using `!important` as much as possible.  Instead of relying on `!important`, try to restructure your CSS to achieve the desired style using more specific selectors or by properly utilizing the cascade.  If you absolutely need to override a style, consider using a more specific selector with a higher priority or using CSS preprocessors to manage your styles more effectively.

Here's an example of a solution using more specific selectors and removing the `!important` declaration:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this revised code, the `.parent .child` selector now correctly overrides the `.child` selector because it's more specific.  Removing the `!important` makes the CSS more maintainable and easier to debug.
