The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, applying `.parent .child` with `color: green` will not override the `!important` declaration in the `.child` selector.  The `!important` flag has higher precedence than even more specific selectors. This often causes unexpected behavior, especially when styles are cascaded across multiple stylesheets or inheritance chains.
